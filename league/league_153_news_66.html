"The first was a big, fat fastball and the last two were hanging curves. All three were mistakes."<br><br>For the game, Harper went 3-for-3 with 4 RBIs and 3 runs scored.<br><br>"There's a fine line between hitting home runs and line drives," Philadelphia manager Joe Girardi said later. "Seems like Bryce found his home run stroke today."<br><br><a href="../players/player_30163.html">Bryce Harper</a> hit a solo-shot off <a href="../players/player_23116.html">Jordan Lyles</a> in the 2nd, hit a solo-shot off <a href="../players/player_23116.html">Jordan Lyles</a> in the 4th, walked in the 4th, walked in the 6th and hit a two-run home run off <a href="../players/player_21720.html">Josh Fields</a> in the 8th.<br><br><a href="../players/player_30163.html">Harper</a> is presently batting .385 with 4 home runs, 4 runs scored and 8 RBIs.
