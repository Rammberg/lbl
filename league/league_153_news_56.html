						It was a good day for the Rays at Minute Maid Park as they clipped the <a href="../teams/team_42.html">Houston Astros</a>, 31-10. It was tremendous day for <a href="../players/player_33998.html">Hunter Renfroe</a>, who was on a hitting barrage at the plate, finishing 5-for-7. <br><br>"I don't know what to call that," the <a href="../teams/team_57.html">Tampa Bay</a> right fielder told reporters after his big performance. "I'm not 'dialed in' or 'in a zone,' I just try to keep it simple. Basically the pitcher throws the ball, I try to pick up the spin, then I hit it. Today I picked up the spin pretty well." <br><br><a href="../players/player_33998.html">Hunter Renfroe</a> grounded out in the 1st, doubled in the 3rd, hit a three-run home run off <a href="../players/player_32121.html">Chris Devenski</a> in the 4th, hit an RBI single in the 5th, grounded out in the 5th, hit a two-run home run off <a href="../players/player_20502.html">Abraham Toro</a> in the 7th, walked in the 8th and singled in the 9th.<br><br>This year <a href="../players/player_33998.html">Renfroe</a> has hit 3 home runs and posted a .241 batting average.<br><br><a href="../box_scores/game_box_906.html">View Boxscore</a>
