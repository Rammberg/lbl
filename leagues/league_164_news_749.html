						It's not something you read about in the sports pages every day -- a 5-for-5 day. For many, it might come around only once in a career -- and for <a href="../players/player_25417.html">Trejyn Fletcher</a>, it came around today. <br><br>The 19-year-old right fielder scattered hits all over Falcon Park to pace the <a href="../teams/team_285.html">State College Spikes</a> to a 7-4 victory over the <a href="../teams/team_281.html">Auburn Doubledays</a>. <br><br><a href="../teams/team_281.html">Auburn</a> skipper <a href="../coaches/coach_1415.html">Patrick Anderson</a> told reporters in the press room that "Fletcher deserves a hat-tip."<br><br>"He hit some good pitches against us," he said. "In fact, according to our scouting reports, Fletcher hit several that he is not supposed to be able to hit." <br><br><a href="../players/player_25417.html">Trejyn Fletcher</a> singled in the 1st, singled in the 2nd, hit an RBI single in the 3rd, tripled in the 5th and doubled in the 8th.<br><br>For the year <a href="../players/player_25417.html">Fletcher</a> is hitting .429 with 1 home run. His stats include 2 RBI and 4 runs scored.
