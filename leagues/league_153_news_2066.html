						It was a great day for <a href="../players/player_18891.html">Joey Votto</a> of the <a href="../teams/team_37.html">Cincinnati Reds</a> -- but not a perfect day. He became the latest player to reach the 2000-hit mark, but his team lost the game. The 37-year-old first baseman got his hit in Cincinnati's 5-3 loss to San Francisco.<br><br>"It was a very special game for me, but not a good one for the team," said Votto after the game. Commenting on his achievement to reporters, he told them, "2000 hits are a lot. It puts you in a very select group. You have to hit well over a lot of seasons to do this. It's a good feeling to have your name in the record books with the other guys who have reached this level."<br><br>He finished the day with 1 hit in 4 at-bats.<br><br>All-time <a href="../players/player_18891.html">Votto</a> has played in 1836 games, batted .306 with 309 home runs and 2000 base hits. <br><br><a href="../box_scores/game_box_2788.html">View Boxscore</a><br><a href="../game_logs/log_2788.html">View Game Log</a>
