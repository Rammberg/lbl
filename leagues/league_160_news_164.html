						It was a good day for the <a href="../teams/team_756.html">Down East Wood Ducks</a> and an exceptional one for <a href="../players/player_20573.html">Sam Huff</a>. The 22-year-old catcher sent three bombs out of the park to help the Wood Ducks beat the <a href="../teams/team_245.html">Lynchburg Hillcats</a> 6-1 at Calvin Falwell Field.<br><br>"When you're in the zone, the game really slows down," <a href="../players/player_20573.html">Huff</a> said when asked about his performance later. "I couldn't even tell you what pitches were thrown. Today feels great, but it is a long season and tomorrow is another day."<br><br>For the day, he scored 3 times, drove in 6 runs and smacked 3 hits in 5 at-bats.<br><br><a href="../players/player_20573.html">Sam Huff</a> grounded out in the 1st, hit a two-run home run off <a href="../players/player_35295.html">Ty Boyles</a> in the 3rd, hit a solo-shot off <a href="../players/player_35295.html">Ty Boyles</a> in the 5th, struck out in the 7th and hit a two-run home run off <a href="../players/player_34200.html">Zack Weiss</a> in the 9th.<br><br>This year <a href="../players/player_20573.html">Huff</a> has hit at a .308 clip with 16 hits, 6 home runs, 15 RBIs and 13 runs scored.
