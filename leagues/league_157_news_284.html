						It's not something you read about in the sports pages every day -- a 5-for-7 day. For many, it might come around only once in a career -- and for <a href="../players/player_23805.html">L.T. Tolbert</a>, it came around today. <br><br>The 23-year-old first baseman scattered hits all over AT&T Field to pace the <a href="../teams/team_203.html">Jackson Generals</a> to a 7-5 victory over the <a href="../teams/team_208.html">Chattanooga Lookouts</a>. <br><br><a href="../teams/team_208.html">Chattanooga</a> skipper <a href="../coaches/coach_2306.html">Ricky Gutierrez</a> told reporters in the press room that "Tolbert deserves a hat-tip."<br><br>"He hit some good pitches against us," he said. "In fact, according to our scouting reports, Tolbert hit several that he is not supposed to be able to hit." <br><br><a href="../players/player_23805.html">L.T. Tolbert</a> hit an RBI double in the 1st, hit an RBI single in the 3rd, hit a two-run double in the 5th, struck out in the 7th, walked in the 9th, struck out in the 12th, singled in the 14th and hit a two-run double in the 15th.<br><br>This year <a href="../players/player_23805.html">Tolbert</a> has hit at a .316 pace and produced 15 RBIs, 1 home run and scored 14 runs.
