						Today at NYSEG Stadium, <a href="../players/player_34239.html">Drew Ward</a> put on an impressive display. <br><br>The <a href="../teams/team_197.html">Harrisburg Senators</a> first baseman tagged <a href="../teams/team_187.html">Binghamton</a> pitching for 5 hits in 6 at-bats, but his teammates were unable to capitalize on the spree and lost the game to the <a href="../teams/team_187.html">Binghamton Rumble Ponies</a> by the score of 8-7.<br><br>"The loss takes some of the joy out of it, but I'll take it," Ward said. "5-for-6 ain't bad in any league."<br><br>Despite the terrific performance, the Senators manager was unwilling to offer his first baseman much praise, saying he holds his "whole roster" accountable for losses.<br><br>"Drew told me 'Coach, I had 5 hits' and I said 'Well that's great, but it looks like we needed one more from you,'" manager Billy Gardner Jr. said.<br><br><a href="../players/player_34239.html">Drew Ward</a> singled in the 1st, singled in the 2nd, singled in the 5th, struck out in the 7th, hit an RBI double in the 9th and hit a solo-shot off <a href="../players/player_33952.html">Nick Rumbelow</a> in the 11th. <br><br>Currently <a href="../players/player_34239.html">Ward</a> has 3 home runs and a .321 batting average.
