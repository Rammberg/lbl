						Yesterday at Dehler Park <a href="../players/player_20746.html">Caleb Van Blake</a> and <a href="../players/player_25144.html">Sam Fuller</a> got into each other's space and then into each other's face. They began to grapple and fell to the ground. That's when it boiled over into a full-fledged bench-clearing tussle between the <a href="../teams/team_333.html">Billings Mustangs</a> and <a href="../teams/team_340.html">Orem Owlz</a>. Reason finally prevailed as the umpires restored order. After much discussion, only the two major combatants were ejected from the game.<br><br>Today the league office notified the ballclubs that <a href="../players/player_20746.html">Van Blake</a> will have to sit out 2 while <a href="../players/player_25144.html">Fuller</a> would be given a 6-game suspension for their roles in the brawl. <br><br>Van Blake is hitting .250 this year with no home runs, 1 RBIs and 1 run scored. He has 6 hits in 24 at-bats, 3 walks and a .357 on-base percentage. <a href="../players/player_20746.html">Van Blake</a> has played in 8 games.<br><br>For the season <a href="../players/player_25144.html">Fuller</a> has logged 2 wins and 1 loss and struck out 22 batters in 25 innings while compiling a 3.24 ERA.
