						After an intense confrontation, both the White Sox <a href="../players/player_36972.html">Jose Abreu</a> and the Indians <a href="../players/player_34323.html">Scott Moss</a> were handed their punishments today. The league commissioner's office issued suspensions for an on-the-field conflict that occurred at a recent <a href="../teams/team_35.html">Chicago</a>-<a href="../teams/team_38.html">Cleveland</a> game. <a href="../players/player_36972.html">Jose Abreu</a> will miss 5 games, while <a href="../players/player_34323.html">Scott Moss</a> was suspended for 6 games.<br><br>"Sometimes we go too far and have to pay the consequences," <a href="../players/player_36972.html">Jose Abreu</a> commented later. "Hopefully cooler heads will prevail the next time we play."<br><br>Looking at his stats this year, <a href="../players/player_36972.html">Abreu</a> has compiled a .252 batting average, while hitting 6 home runs and driving in 27 runs. He has played in 66 games and scored 28 runs.<br><br>In 2 starts this season <a href="../players/player_34323.html">Moss</a> has gathered no wins while suffering 1 loss.
