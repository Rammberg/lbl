To share a field with such incredible players is always a humbling experience. But after the first couple pitches, you just have to ignore the talent out there and focus on your game," Knizner commented as he accepted his award after the game.<br><br><a href="../players/player_39313.html">Knizner</a> is batting .295 lifetime with 143 hits, 22 doubles, no triples, 19 home runs, 80 RBIs to date.
