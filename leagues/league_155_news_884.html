						It was a good day for the River Cats at Las Vegas Ballpark as they clipped the <a href="../teams/team_162.html">Las Vegas Aviators</a>, 10-7. It was tremendous day for <a href="../players/player_35718.html">Mauricio Dubon</a>, who was on a hitting barrage at the plate, finishing 5-for-5. <br><br>"I don't know what to call that," the <a href="../teams/team_185.html">Sacramento</a> second baseman told reporters after his big performance. "I'm not 'dialed in' or 'in a zone,' I just try to keep it simple. Basically the pitcher throws the ball, I try to pick up the spin, then I hit it. Today I picked up the spin pretty well." <br><br><a href="../players/player_35718.html">Mauricio Dubon</a> singled in the 1st, hit a two-run double in the 2nd, hit a solo-shot off <a href="../players/player_33136.html">Stephen Johnson</a> in the 4th, singled in the 6th, singled in the 7th and was hit by a pitch in the 9th.<br><br>Currently <a href="../players/player_35718.html">Dubon</a> is hitting .331 and has collected 7 home runs, 41 RBIs and scored 32 times, while playing in 66 games.
