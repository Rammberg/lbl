						<a href="../players/player_26393.html">Steven Kwan</a> was on quite a roll today as he knocked the ball all over Canal Park, collecting 5 hits. His day of glory wasn't able to win the game, however. The <a href="../teams/team_195.html">Bowie Baysox</a> got the 6-5 victory over the <a href="../teams/team_193.html">Akron RubberDucks</a>.<br><br>"I never realized that a few hits could cause so much commotion," the left fielder said in the clubhouse after the game, crowded by reporters. "Headlines and highlights are great, but it takes a lot of luster off it that we lost."<br><br>After his first couple of hits, all eyes in the ballpark were on him each time <a href="../players/player_26393.html">Kwan</a> stepped into the batter's box. Even some opposing fans were pulling for him, knowing they were watching a little slice of baseball history unfold. <br><br>When asked what the secret of hitting so well is, he smiled and said "relax, concentrate, and hit the ball where they ain't." <br><br>That's exactly what he did today, as Kwan finished the game with 5 hits in 5 at-bats and a line in the record book. <a href="../players/player_26393.html">Steven Kwan</a> singled in the 1st, singled in the 3rd, singled in the 5th, singled in the 7th and hit a two-run double in the 8th.<br><br>This season <a href="../players/player_26393.html">Kwan</a> is swinging the bat at a .368 pace. He has hit 1 home run and scored 7 times, while driving in 6. His on-base percentage is .429 and he has played in 14 games.
