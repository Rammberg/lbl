						"It's worse than we thought." That was the news from the Phillies clubhouse today as it was learned that shortstop <a href="../players/player_29632.html">Didi Gregorius</a> will be out for an added 2 weeks as a result of a recent injury. His treatment for a strained rib cage muscle will have to be extended. Initially it didn't seem the injury was a major concern, but the <a href="../teams/team_51.html">Philadelphia</a> shortstop told team trainers of some discomfort yesterday morning, and upon examination it was determined to be a more serious injury. "We'd rather take this thing slowly and make sure <a href="../players/player_29632.html">Didi</a> gets back onto the field healthy," said the team's head trainer. <br><br>This season <a href="../players/player_29632.html">Gregorius</a> is batting .287 with 69 hits, 15 home runs, 47 RBIs, 14 walks, .323 OBP and has scored 37 runs. He has played in 60 games.
