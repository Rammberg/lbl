						<a href="../coaches/coach_151.html">Ron Roenicke</a> is well known for being an easygoing manager and he's taken that to a whole new level.<br><br>The <a href="../teams/team_34.html">Boston Red Sox</a> skipper has instituted a 'Casual Friday' policy for his club. While the team is expected to dress in professional looking attire throughout the season, he's allowing them to dress however they want one day a week.<br><br>"Jeans, T-shirts, shorts, whatever," he said. "They do it in offices, so why not with a pro ball team? And while it's casual on Friday, I think the guys know they can be pretty casual the rest of the week too. Being comfortable is more important than looking like a suit model."<br><br>The players say their manager's approach has been well received.<br><br>"He's pretty relaxed, makes it easier for us to just relax as well and focus on baseball," said <a href="../players/player_29710.html">Martin Perez</a>.
