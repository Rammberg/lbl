						In an announcement today, the league informed <a href="../players/player_19933.html">Drew Ellis</a> of <a href="../teams/team_203.html">Jackson</a> and <a href="../players/player_32769.html">Mike Morin</a> of <a href="../teams/team_201.html">Biloxi</a> that they both had been suspended 4 games for fighting in a recent game.<br><br>The league president told them, "This type of aggressive behavior will not be tolerated in this league."<br><br><a href="../players/player_19933.html">Ellis</a> wasn't happy with the length of his suspension. He thought he got the worst deal and told the league commissioner, "In any fight, whoever throws the first punch should get a more severe penalty. If I threw the first punch, I'd expect to get the most punishment. Whoever took the blow should get a lesser punishment."<br><br>His manager agreed with him and said something needs to be done about it. "<a href="../players/player_19933.html">Ellis</a> is right. The league needs to look at its policy and make sure the punishment fits the crime."<br><br><a href="../players/player_19933.html">Ellis</a> is swinging at a .257 pace on the year with 10 home runs, 27 RBIs and 27 runs scored. He has played in 43 games. <br><br><a href="../players/player_32769.html">Morin</a> has taken the mound for 9 relief appearances this season, nailing down no saves while notching a 0-2 record with a 4.96 ERA. The <a href="../teams/team_201.html">Biloxi</a> reliever has limited opposing batters to a .284 batting average.
