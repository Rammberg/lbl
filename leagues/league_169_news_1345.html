						Upon hearing the news that he had won the Pioneer League Pitcher of the Month honors for July's work, <a href="../teams/team_337.html">Grand Junction</a> reliever <a href="../players/player_1516.html">Diego Blanco</a> merely smiled.<br><br>"That's just the kind of guy he is, and that's what makes him so good out there," his manager told reporters. "The guy has ice water in his veins. Nothing short of a League Championship could get this guy excited and I'm not so sure that'd do it either."<br><br>Blanco made 11 relief appearances burning through 11.2 innings as he racked up 7 saves, 6 strikeouts and held batters to a .081 average as he notched a 3-0 record and a 0.77 ERA.<br><br>On the year, <a href="../players/player_1516.html">Blanco</a> has recorded 8 saves with a 3-2 record over 15 innings. He has mowed down 12 batters on strikes and walked 3 with an ERA of 3.60.
