						Sometimes the winner is the one who got the lucky bounces and the lucky calls, and sometimes the winner is just the one who played better.<br><br>It was the latter case in 2020, as the <a href="../teams/team_319.html">Miami (GCL) Marlins</a> topped the <a href="../teams/team_326.html">New York A E (GCL) Yankees East</a> 3-2 tonight at Roger Dean Stadium to win the Round 3. It was the 1st title in franchise history.<br><br>"When you play for championships, you have to play better than the team in the other dugout. We did that in this series, and all year. Now we're the best team in baseball," said Miami (GCL) center fielder <a href="../players/player_20858.html">Thomas Jones</a>, who was named series MVP.<br><br>The Marlins took the series 3-1. The new titleholders completed the regular season with a second-place finish in the  East Division and a 30-26 record. <br><br>Miami (GCL) manager Robert Rodriguez grinned and nodded when asked to comment on Jones's words.<br><br>"Thomas said it best -- we played better than the other team," he said.<br><br>Hometown officials announced they were already planning a "grand celebration" for the winners in the days to come.
