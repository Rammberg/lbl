						<a href="../teams/team_160.html">Rochester</a> right fielder <a href="../players/player_33546.html">Willians Astudillo</a> could do no wrong in today's 5-4 win over the Indians as he collected 5 hits. <br><br>"Things were in his favor in every one of his at-bats," Indians skipper <a href="../coaches/coach_1595.html">Brian Esposito</a> said to the press corps after the game. "He got hitters' counts."<br><br><a href="../players/player_33546.html">Astudillo</a> agreed, saying that getting ahead early in the counts was "the key" to his game.<br><br>"Once you get ahead, it makes it a lot easier because you get a better pitch to hit," he said. "You know the pitcher has to come in with it. And you're ready."<br><br><a href="../players/player_33546.html">Willians Astudillo</a> singled in the 1st, flied out in the 3rd, singled in the 5th, flied out in the 6th, singled in the 9th, singled in the 11th, grounded out in the 13th and singled in the 15th.<br><br>So far this year in 43 games Astudillo is hitting .358 with 4 home runs, 18 RBIs and 21 runs scored.
