						<a href="../teams/team_309.html">Milwaukee (AZL)</a> third baseman <a href="../players/player_39880.html">Nick Egnatuk</a> could do no wrong in today's 6-1 win over the Rangers as he collected 5 hits. <br><br>"Things were in his favor in every one of his at-bats," Rangers skipper <a href="../coaches/coach_2176.html">Buddy Carlyle</a> said to the press corps after the game. "He got hitters' counts."<br><br><a href="../players/player_39880.html">Egnatuk</a> agreed, saying that getting ahead early in the counts was "the key" to his game.<br><br>"Once you get ahead, it makes it a lot easier because you get a better pitch to hit," he said. "You know the pitcher has to come in with it. And you're ready."<br><br><a href="../players/player_39880.html">Nick Egnatuk</a> singled in the 2nd, hit an RBI double in the 4th, singled in the 5th, hit an RBI single in the 7th and singled in the 9th.<br><br><a href="../players/player_39880.html">Egnatuk</a> has a .526 average and a .571 on-base percentage for the year. He has picked up 10 hits, no home runs and driven in 3 runs.
