						The <a href="../teams/team_249.html">Fort Wayne TinCaps</a> downed the <a href="../teams/team_252.html">West Michigan Whitecaps</a> 5-4 today at Parkview Field, in spite of the best efforts of West Michigan shortstop <a href="../players/player_21106.html">Wenceel Perez</a>. Perez lashed the ball all over the park in a 5-hit explosion, finishing with a 5-for-5 line -- and a loss. <br><br>"I don't remember a better day batting, but it sure is disappointing to lose the game," he said to BNN reporters in the postgame interview. "A win would have made the day much sweeter."<br><br>Asked if he would adjust his strategy next time the TinCaps face Perez, Fort Wayne manager <a href="../coaches/coach_1688.html">Anthony Contreras</a> said "absolutely not."<br><br>"Our strategy was to not give him good pitches to hit," he said. "We didn't do that, and he worked us over. Thankfully, we won anyway, and next time we'll pitch to him better."<br><br><a href="../players/player_21106.html">Wenceel Perez</a> singled in the 1st, doubled in the 3rd, singled in the 5th, doubled in the 7th and singled in the 9th.<br><br>This season <a href="../players/player_21106.html">Perez</a> is hitting .302 with 1 home run.
