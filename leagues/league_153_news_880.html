"I couldn't even tell you what pitches were thrown. Today feels great, but it is a long season and tomorrow is another day."<br><br>For the day, he scored 4 times, drove in 4 runs and smacked 4 hits in 6 at-bats.<br><br><a href="../players/player_30132.html">Jurickson Profar</a> flied out in the 1st, hit a solo-shot off <a href="../players/player_23612.html">Jake Arrieta</a> in the 3rd, grounded out in the 4th, hit a two-run home run off <a href="../players/player_21638.html">Trevor Bettencourt</a> in the 6th, singled in the 8th and hit a solo-shot off <a href="../players/player_35843.html">Victor Arano</a> in the 9th.<br><br>This season <a href="../players/player_30132.html">Profar</a> has hit at a .286 clip with 52 RBIs, 11 home runs and 39 runs scored.
