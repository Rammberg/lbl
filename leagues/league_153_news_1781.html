						Hitting three home runs in a game is usually something to celebrate, but there was no celebration to be found at Guaranteed Rate Field after the hitting barrage from <a href="../players/player_37022.html">Yoan Moncada</a>. The <a href="../teams/team_35.html">Chicago White Sox</a> dropped the contest 12-9 to the <a href="../teams/team_42.html">Houston Astros</a>, leaving Moncada with only a historical footnote as consolation.<br><br>Yoan is blessed with a natural home run swing so he gets the ball up in the air real quickly," Chicago manager Rick Renteria said after the loss. "It's just a shame we couldn't win the game, too. I'm sure it spoils the day a little for him."<br><br>Along with putting three in the stands, Moncada went 4-for-5 with 5 RBIs and 3 runs scored.<br><br>"It's rare that you actually try to hit a home run," he told reporters after the game. "Mostly you'll fail if you really try to hit one, but today I tried on the last one."<br><br><a href="../players/player_37022.html">Yoan Moncada</a> doubled in the 1st, struck out in the 3rd, hit a solo-shot off <a href="../players/player_25041.html">Brad Peacock</a> in the 6th, hit a two-run home run off <a href="../players/player_21177.html">Forrest Whitley</a> in the 7th and hit a two-run home run off <a href="../players/player_35247.html">Austin Pruitt</a> in the 8th.<br><br>On the year <a href="../players/player_37022.html">Moncada</a> has hit .284 with 30 home runs, 92 RBIs and scored 93 runs.
