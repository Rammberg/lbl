						The <a href="../teams/team_270.html">Augusta GreenJackets</a> were not very happy with the home plate umpire in today's loss to <a href="../teams/team_266.html">Lexington</a> at SRP Park. One in particular -- <a href="../players/player_1333.html">Tyler Fitzgerald</a>. Upon being called out on strikes, the GreenJackets shortstop gave the ump quite an earful. For that, the man in blue gave him the thumb and sent him to an early shower.<br><br>But the disgruntled Fitzgerald lingered on the field for another five minutes, berating the umpire. Finally his manager got him off the field and into the clubhouse.<br><br>But it got worse after the game, when Fitzgerald told reporters, "He was blind today. They played 'Three Blind Mice' for him. If he doesn't know the words to the song, I'm sure we can get it in Braille, so he can follow along."<br><br>For his escapades and after-the-game oration, the league office suspended Fitzgerald for 4 games.<br><br>This year <a href="../players/player_1333.html">Fitzgerald</a> is hitting .353, produced 4 RBIs and 0 home runs, scored 3 times and gotten on base at a .429 rate.
