						It doesn't happen very often, but it did for <a href="../players/player_27154.html">Bryan Reynolds</a> today -- a 5-hit day. He went on a rampage and sparkled on the diamond at PNC Park, but the performance lost a little luster when the Pirates were downed 27-26 by the <a href="../teams/team_36.html">Chicago Cubs</a>. <br><br>After his glittering performance, the <a href="../teams/team_52.html">Pittsburgh</a> left fielder told the press that he "just tried to get myself in a good count and have a good at-bat." <br><br>His batting theory paid dividends today as he slammed 5 hits in 8 tries and put his name in the record book.<br><br>"I just wish we had added a win in the record book today, too," Reynolds said.<br><br><a href="../players/player_27154.html">Bryan Reynolds</a> grounded out in the 1st, singled in the 3rd, grounded out in the 4th, hit a two-run single in the 5th, struck out in the 7th, singled in the 8th, hit an RBI double in the 9th, singled in the 10th and walked in a run in the 10th.<br><br>Presently <a href="../players/player_27154.html">Reynolds</a> is batting .327 with 52 hits and 2 home runs. He has knocked in 28 runs and scored 33 times.<br><br><a href="../box_scores/game_box_1316.html">View Boxscore</a><br><a href="../game_logs/log_1316.html">View Game Log</a>
