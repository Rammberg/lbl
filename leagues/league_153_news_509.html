						Sometimes injuries happen when you least expect them. During his morning workout, <a href="../players/player_29446.html">Jean Segura</a> of the Phillies reportedly injured himself falling off of the treadmill. Segura was "too embarrassed to discuss details", and added that the injury to his leg was significant enough to place him on the disabled list, where he will miss "some time". Teammate <a href="../players/player_19.html">Aaron Nola</a> added "Watching him slide off of that treadmill was really scary. I've heard of that kind of thing happening elsewhere, and I think it was only a matter of time before something like that happened here. I'm downright terrified to step on a treadmill now." The equipment was taken offline until a thorough safety check could be performed to try and identify the root cause of the mishap.
