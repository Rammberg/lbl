						A jubilant <a href="../players/player_37022.html">Yoan Moncada</a> joined the postgame press conference at Guaranteed Rate Field today to offer some unusual words of encouragement -- for the <a href="../teams/team_43.html">Kansas City Royals</a> pitching staff he had just vanquished.<br><br>"It may not have looked like it," said the <a href="../teams/team_35.html">Chicago White Sox</a> third baseman, "but I saw some awful good pitches today. If luck hadn't been on my side it might have turned out a lot different." <br><br>That would not have been the conclusion of anyone who saw his dominant 5-for-5 hitting performance, which led the White Sox to a 22-17 win.<br><br>"He made it look easy," said <a href="../coaches/coach_1269.html">Mike Matheny</a>, manager of the Royals. "We never figured out what to do with him. Obviously."<br><br><a href="../players/player_37022.html">Yoan Moncada</a> hit an RBI single in the 1st, singled in the 2nd, singled in the 4th, hit a two-run home run off <a href="../players/player_35448.html">Glenn Sparkman</a> in the 5th, hit a solo-shot off <a href="../players/player_18880.html">Ian Kennedy</a> in the 6th and walked in the 8th.<br><br>This season <a href="../players/player_37022.html">Moncada</a> is swinging the bat at a .286 pace. He has hit 3 home runs and scored 8 times, while driving in 6. His on-base percentage is .324 and he has played in 8 games.<br><br><a href="../box_scores/game_box_923.html">View Boxscore</a>
