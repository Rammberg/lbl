						After a 5-hit effort to lead <a href="../teams/team_56.html">St. Louis</a>'s 35-33 victory over the <a href="../teams/team_37.html">Cincinnati Reds</a>,  right fielder <a href="../players/player_34168.html">Tyler O'Neill</a> told BNN beat writers it had been "a special day."<br><br>"It really doesn't matter whether it's sandlot ball, high school or college, two hits in a game is nice," he said. "Three or four is better, but five or more is out of sight. And to do that at the Major League Baseball-level is really something special." <br><br>The 25-year-old player earned his accolades today at Great American Ball Park with a spectacular 5-for-6 game against the Reds. <br><br>"His swing is getting there," said Cardinals skipper Mike Shildt, who spoke glowingly of <a href="../players/player_34168.html">O'Neill</a> after the game. "We want him to be quick with his swing, short and compact. We want him to be patient and go the other way when he can. <a href="../players/player_34168.html">Tyler</a> did that to perfection today." <br><br><a href="../players/player_34168.html">Tyler O'Neill</a> walked in the 1st, walked in the 2nd, hit an RBI single in the 4th, hit an RBI single in the 5th, struck out in the 7th, hit a GRAND SLAM off <a href="../players/player_37015.html">Raisel Iglesias</a> in the 7th, hit a two-run home run off <a href="../players/player_35902.html">Aristides Aquino</a> in the 8th, walked in the 9th and hit an RBI single in the 10th.<br><br><a href="../players/player_34168.html">O'Neill</a> is hitting at a .246 mark this season. His stats show 21 home runs, 78 RBIs and 51 runs scored. He has played 96 games for the <a href="../teams/team_56.html">Cardinals</a>.<br><br><a href="../box_scores/game_box_2558.html">View Boxscore</a><br><a href="../game_logs/log_2558.html">View Game Log</a>
