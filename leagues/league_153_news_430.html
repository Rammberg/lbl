						Today at Guaranteed Rate Field, <a href="../players/player_30499.html">Jorge Polanco</a> put on an impressive display. <br><br>The <a href="../teams/team_47.html">Minnesota Twins</a> shortstop tagged <a href="../teams/team_35.html">Chicago</a> pitching for 5 hits in 5 at-bats, but his teammates were unable to capitalize on the spree and lost the game to the <a href="../teams/team_35.html">Chicago White Sox</a> by the score of 18-16.<br><br>"The loss takes some of the joy out of it, but I'll take it," Polanco said. "5-for-5 ain't bad in any league."<br><br>Despite the terrific performance, the Twins manager was unwilling to offer his shortstop much praise, saying he holds his "whole roster" accountable for losses.<br><br>"Jorge told me 'Coach, I had 5 hits' and I said 'Well that's great, but it looks like we needed one more from you,'" manager Rocco Baldelli said.<br><br><a href="../players/player_30499.html">Jorge Polanco</a> singled in the 2nd, singled in the 3rd, walked in the 4th, singled in the 5th, hit an RBI triple in the 6th and singled in the 8th. <br><br><a href="../players/player_30499.html">Polanco</a> is presently batting .340 with 4 home runs, 31 runs scored and 17 RBIs. His OBP is .386.<br><br><a href="../box_scores/game_box_1438.html">View Boxscore</a><br><a href="../game_logs/log_1438.html">View Game Log</a>
