Or trot around them, like I did today."<br><br><a href="../players/player_38149.html">Yordan Alvarez</a> hit a solo-shot off <a href="../players/player_28469.html">Lance Lynn</a> in the 1st, hit a solo-shot off <a href="../players/player_31278.html">Rafael Montero</a> in the 3rd, hit a two-run double in the 3rd, hit a three-run home run off <a href="../players/player_33402.html">Matt Duffy</a> in the 4th, walked in the 5th, grounded out in the 6th and struck out in the 7th.<br><br><a href="../players/player_38149.html">Alvarez</a> on the season is hitting .369 with 20 home runs.
