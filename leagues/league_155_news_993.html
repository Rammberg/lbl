"Most of the time you fail, if you really try to hit one. But today, I was really trying on that last one."<br><br>In all, he was 3-for-4 as the Isotopes toppled <a href="../teams/team_180.html">El Paso</a> by a score of 10-2, knocking in 5 runs and scoring 3 times.<br><br>"He is blessed with a natural home run swing," Albuquerque manager Warren Schaeffer said. "He gets the ball up in the air."<br><br><a href="../players/player_1007.html">Mike Gerber</a> hit a two-run home run off <a href="../players/player_35270.html">Hunter Adkins</a> in the 1st, grounded out in the 3rd, hit a solo-shot off <a href="../players/player_34503.html">Jimmy Yacabonis</a> in the 5th and hit a two-run home run off <a href="../players/player_18981.html">Marco Estrada</a> in the 7th.<br><br><a href="../players/player_1007.html">Gerber</a> is batting .291 with 13 home runs and 54 RBIs this season.
