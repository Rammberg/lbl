						The <a href="../teams/team_339.html">Ogden Raptors</a> and <a href="../teams/team_337.html">Grand Junction Rockies</a> didn't hold back anything in the Round 1, with each team pulling out all the stops in an effort to advance to the Round 2.<br><br>Ogden won the final game by a score of 7-1 at Lindquist Field and that concluded the series, 2-1.<br><br>"Relief is the biggest thing," Ogden left fielder <a href="../players/player_26506.html">Joe Vranesh</a> said when asked how he felt. "It's a grind both mentally and physically to have a long series like this, but our guys stuck with it and Grand Junction deserves credit for the hard fight."<br><br>Vranesh paced the Ogden offence and earned MVP honors. For the series, he hit .417 with a .462 on-base percentage, 1 home runs, 1 RBI and scored 2 runs.<br><br>The <a href="../teams/team_339.html">Ogden Raptors</a> will play against the <a href="../teams/team_333.html">Billings Mustangs</a> in the next round.
