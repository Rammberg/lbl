						It's not something you read about in the sports pages every day -- a 6-for-7 day. For many, it might come around only once in a career -- and for <a href="../players/player_20505.html">Nicky Lopez</a>, it came around today. <br><br>The 25-year-old second baseman scattered hits all over Colorado Field to pace the <a href="../teams/team_43.html">Kansas City Royals</a> to a 22-7 victory over the <a href="../teams/team_39.html">Colorado Rockies</a>. <br><br><a href="../teams/team_39.html">Colorado</a> skipper <a href="../coaches/coach_276.html">Bud Black</a> told reporters in the press room that "Lopez deserves a hat-tip."<br><br>"He hit some good pitches against us," he said. "In fact, according to our scouting reports, Lopez hit several that he is not supposed to be able to hit." <br><br><a href="../players/player_20505.html">Nicky Lopez</a> singled in the 1st, hit an RBI triple in the 3rd, singled in the 4th, hit an RBI single in the 5th, walked in a run in the 6th, grounded out in the 7th, hit a two-run single in the 8th and hit an RBI single in the 9th.<br><br><a href="../players/player_20505.html">Lopez</a> has collected 92 hits for the <a href="../teams/team_43.html">Royals</a> this year, 4 of them home runs. He has also netted 40 RBIs and scored 47 runs while batting .336. <br><br><a href="../box_scores/game_box_1747.html">View Boxscore</a><br><a href="../game_logs/log_1747.html">View Game Log</a>
