						5 hits in a game has always been a big milestone in baseball -- 5 hits in a game gets a player's name in the record book, win or lose. <a href="../players/player_20573.html">Sam Huff</a> got his name recorded today, but the <a href="../teams/team_227.html">Frederick Keys</a> picked up the win at Grainger Stadium, topping the <a href="../teams/team_756.html">Down East Wood Ducks</a>, 9-4. <br><br>"He bushwhacked us," said winning manager <a href="../coaches/coach_1793.html">Kyle Moore</a>. "We were lucky to come out ahead."<br><br>Huff, who is tied for 2nd in the CAR in total bases with 70, spoke to reporters in the clubhouse following the game, saying his nerves only set in once he was on the cusp of the milestone.<br><br>"I got too much adrenaline going when I realized that this could be a once-in-a-lifetime day," the catcher said. "I think the coaches could tell I was going to be ready to swing at anything close. That's why my third base coach told me to calm down and wait for a good pitch. That got me back on track."<br><br><a href="../players/player_20573.html">Sam Huff</a> singled in the 1st, singled in the 3rd, struck out in the 5th, struck out in the 7th, walked in the 10th, singled in the 13th, singled in the 15th and singled in the 18th.<br><br>This season <a href="../players/player_20573.html">Huff</a> is batting .300 with 23 RBIs, 22 runs scored and 8 home runs.
