						It was a good day for the Nationals at Nationals Park as they clipped the <a href="../teams/team_41.html">Miami Marlins</a>, 29-22. It was tremendous day for <a href="../players/player_29949.html">Yan Gomes</a>, who was on a hitting barrage at the plate, finishing 5-for-6. <br><br>"I don't know what to call that," the <a href="../teams/team_60.html">Washington</a> catcher told reporters after his big performance. "I'm not 'dialed in' or 'in a zone,' I just try to keep it simple. Basically the pitcher throws the ball, I try to pick up the spin, then I hit it. Today I picked up the spin pretty well." <br><br><a href="../players/player_29949.html">Yan Gomes</a> flied out in the 2nd, singled in the 4th, singled in the 5th, singled in the 6th, hit a two-run single in the 7th, walked in a run in the 8th and hit an RBI single in the 8th.<br><br>This season <a href="../players/player_29949.html">Gomes</a> is batting .311 with 23 hits and 4 home runs. He has scored 11 times and has 15 runs batted in.<br><br><a href="../box_scores/game_box_1345.html">View Boxscore</a><br><a href="../game_logs/log_1345.html">View Game Log</a>
