						The action was hot and heavy at a recent <a href="../teams/team_48.html">New York</a>-<a href="../teams/team_33.html">Baltimore</a> game at Yankee Stadium in more ways than one. When tempers flared, both benches emptied and a mild melee ensued. The only thing hurt was a few players' pride. Two of the main figures in the brawl were suspended today by league officials. The Yankees <a href="../players/player_25307.html">Giancarlo Stanton</a> and <a href="../teams/team_33.html">Baltimore</a>'s <a href="../players/player_27292.html">Travis Lakins</a> will each miss 4 games for their roles in the fight.<br><br>"We do not condone this kind of behavior on the field," the league announcement read. "As such, we believe that this punishment fits the actions taken by these two players. We hope that there will not be a repeat of the incident or else the consequences will be even more severe."<br><br>This season <a href="../players/player_25307.html">Stanton</a> has 35 home runs and a .234 batting average.<br><br>For the season <a href="../players/player_27292.html">Lakins</a> has 1 save, tossed 55.1 innings, fanned 42 batters and produced an ERA of 7.32. He has also been credited with 2 wins and 1 loss.
