						In a true baseball rarity, <a href="../players/player_37609.html">Luis Castillo</a> of the <a href="../teams/team_37.html">Cincinnati Reds</a> no-hit the <a href="../teams/team_56.html">St. Louis Cardinals</a> at Busch Stadium today and -- incredibly -- still took the loss.<br><br>The right-handed Castillo shackled the Cardinals all game, allowing no hits over 8.2 innings. However, St. Louis was able to cobble together enough through other means to outscore the hapless Reds offense and take an unlikely 1-0 win.<br><br>"There's no getting around it, we mucked it up for Luis today," Cincinnati manager David Bell said. "We always tell them 'Go out there and pitch a good game and we'll take care of the rest.' Well, he gave us an incredible game and we blew it, plain and simple."<br><br>A visibly upset Castillo declined to speak with BNN reporters following the game. He recorded 8 strikeouts and surrendered 1 walk in a sensational performance that will nevertheless go into the league record books as a loss.<br><br>This year <a href="../players/player_37609.html">Castillo</a> has posted a record of 9 wins and 9 losses with a 3.92 ERA. He has appeared in 22 games and struck out 138 in 131 innings. <br><br><a href="../box_scores/game_box_2316.html">View Boxscore</a><br><a href="../game_logs/log_2316.html">View Game Log</a>
