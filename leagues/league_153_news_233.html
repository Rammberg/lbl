						Tailgaters and fans of the <a href="../teams/team_47.html">Minnesota Twins</a> got the surprise of their life before yesterday's game as fan favorite, <a href="../players/player_34176.html">Mitch Garver</a>, drove into the stadium parking lot in a custom built luxury RV. <br><br>He chose a parking spot amongst the many other tailgating fans and joined them for some pre-game revelries.<br><br>"These are hands down, the coolest fans in all of baseball. How could you not want to come hang out here," <a href="../players/player_34176.html">Garver</a> said while grilling brats on the RV's custom fold out grill station. <br><br>By the time he had to depart for pre-game warm-ups and exercises, the bus was swarming with several dozen fans, all trying to get a chance to shake his hand and get a picture with the humble star.<br><br>"I love coming down here. I feed off the energy of the crowd. It's great to shake some hands, hear some stories and have that positive energy going into the ballpark," he said, noting he plans to make pre and post-game tailgating at his RV a regular occurrence.
