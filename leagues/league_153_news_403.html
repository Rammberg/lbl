						It seemed that <a href="../teams/team_51.html">Philadelphia</a> second baseman <a href="../players/player_29446.html">Jean Segura</a> could do no wrong as the Phillies KO'd the Brewers, 26-23 today. Segura rapped out 5 hits in 8 at-bats and seemed to know which pitches Brewers hurlers were throwing. <br><br>"I think the Phillies were stealing signs," growled one unhappy <a href="../teams/team_46.html">Milwaukee</a> fan after the game. <br><br>"I just felt good today. I saw the ball well and just wanted to make good contact and put the ball in play," said the jubilant <a href="../players/player_29446.html">Segura</a> in the postgame press interview. <br><br><a href="../players/player_29446.html">Jean Segura</a> struck out in the 2nd, hit a two-run double in the 3rd, singled in the 4th, singled in the 5th, hit a two-run home run off <a href="../players/player_23744.html">Blake Wood</a> in the 6th, hit an RBI single in the 6th, grounded out in the 8th and grounded out in the 9th.<br><br>Segura is hitting .297 this year with 3 home runs and 23 RBIs. He also has an OBP of .353, 11 walks and scored 22 times.<br><br><a href="../box_scores/game_box_816.html">View Boxscore</a><br><a href="../game_logs/log_816.html">View Game Log</a>
