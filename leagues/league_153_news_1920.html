						Miami shortstop <a href="../players/player_1270.html">Jazz Chisholm</a> may miss a week's worth of games due to a clubhouse prank gone wrong. According to teammates, <a href="../players/player_32655.html">Lewis Brinson</a> decided to try and give Chisholm a fright by donning a mask and sneaking up on him in the shower. The prank worked. Unfortunately for the Marlins, it worked a little too well. Chisholm apparently was so startled by the intrusion that he instinctively flung his arm around to defend himself and unintentionally hit his hand against the shower knob. Chisholm sustained a laceration to his hand, which required several stitches, as well as a bruised thumb. "Jazz was surprisingly good-natured about the incident," said manager Don Mattingly. "Nonetheless, he'll be out for the next few games and that's gonna hurts us." Mattingly declined to say whether Brinson would be disciplined for the prank, but says he does believe he is sincerely remorseful for what happened. "I know Lewis feels worse about it than anyone, but I'll have to decide whether or not that's sufficient punishment. Either way, we'll handle the matter privately."
