						<span style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:bold;">Monday, June 8th, 2020</span><br>
						It was a sensational day at the plate for <a href="../players/player_32465.html">Miguel Andujar</a> as he led the charge to a 35-5 win over the Rangers. The <a href="../teams/team_48.html">New York</a> third baseman was pure misery for the <a href="../teams/team_58.html">Texas</a> pitching staff. He left them shell-shocked with 6 hits in 8 at-bats in an explosive display of hitting. <br><br>"<a href="../players/player_32465.html">Andujar</a> put the ball into play and he really hit it hard," said <a href="../coaches/coach_2418.html">Chris Woodward</a>, manager for the Rangers, after the game. "When you do that, you've got a good chance to do some damage. And that's what happened. I feel like we threw some good pitches, but he just put some good swings on the ball." <br><br><a href="../players/player_32465.html">Miguel Andujar</a> flied out in the 2nd, singled in the 4th, hit a two-run single in the 4th, singled in the 5th, hit an RBI single in the 6th, singled in the 7th, singled in the 8th and struck out in the 9th.<br><br>Thus far this season in 40 games Andujar is batting .392 with 12 home runs, 53 RBIs and 41 runs scored. He has 71 hits in 181 at-bats.<br><br><a href="../box_scores/game_box_831.html">View Boxscore</a><br><a href="../game_logs/log_831.html">View Game Log</a>
