						Fans at Riverfront Stadium got to see not only a home-team victory today, but also one of the most impressive feats of hitting of the season.<br><br>The <a href="../teams/team_175.html">Wichita Wind Surge</a> outplayed the <a href="../teams/team_180.html">El Paso Chihuahuas</a> en route to a 5-4 win, but the standout was second baseman <a href="../players/player_32178.html">Christian Lopes</a>. Lopes netted 5 hits in 6 at-bats and finished with a dynamite game line. <br><br>"Hey, we tried everything we could think of to get him out," Chihuahuas manager <a href="../coaches/coach_589.html">Edwin Rodriguez</a> said in his postgame comments. "We threw everything but the kitchen sink against him and he hit it. Maybe we should've thrown the sink, too." <br><br><a href="../players/player_32178.html">Christian Lopes</a> grounded out in the 1st, singled in the 3rd, singled in the 5th, singled in the 7th, singled in the 9th and singled in the 11th.<br><br>Thus far this season Lopes is hitting .274 with 2 home runs, 22 RBIs and 29 runs scored. He has 49 hits in 179 at-bats and has played in 47 games.
