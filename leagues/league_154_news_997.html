						There aren't many who could be pro ballplayers and there are even fewer who could put up 5 hits in a day.<br><br><a href="../players/player_19627.html">Yolbert Sanchez</a> is one of those rare few, as he went 5-for-6 against the <a href="../teams/team_168.html">Indianapolis Indians</a> at BB&T Stadium today. The monster effort from the 23-year-old shortstop helped the <a href="../teams/team_163.html">Charlotte Knights</a> take the win, 12-3. <br><br>"We made some bad pitches and he took advantage of it," said Indians manager <a href="../coaches/coach_1595.html">Brian Esposito</a>. "That's the game, though. Don't make mistakes and you'll win ballgames. Make mistakes and, well, you saw what happened today." <br><br><a href="../players/player_19627.html">Yolbert Sanchez</a> singled in the 1st, singled in the 3rd, singled in the 4th, flied out in the 5th, hit a two-run double in the 7th and singled in the 8th.<br><br>Thus far this season in 17 games Sanchez is batting .351 with 1 home run, 6 RBIs and 18 runs scored. He has 27 hits in 77 at-bats.
