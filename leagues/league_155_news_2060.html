						When fights happen, suspensions are not far behind. That axiom was held to be true today when <a href="../teams/team_185.html">Sacramento</a>'s <a href="../players/player_21404.html">Chris Shaw</a> and <a href="../teams/team_180.html">El Paso</a>'s <a href="../players/player_34425.html">Chih-Wei Hu</a> were given a temporary vacation from the game, courtesy of the league commissioner's office.<br><br>They both were suspended for 4 games for their actions in a recent ruckus between the two teams. Both benches cleared when <a href="../players/player_21404.html">Shaw</a> charged <a href="../players/player_34425.html">Hu</a>.<br><br>Both players have accepted their fate and will begin serving their suspensions immediately. Neither would talk to reporters about the confrontation.<br><br>Shaw is hitting .260 so far this season with 50 RBIs and 43 runs scored. He has 75 hits including 18 home runs, 21 walks and .323 OBP. <br><br>For the season <a href="../players/player_34425.html">Hu</a> has made 15 relief appearances, recorded no saves, compiled a 3-1 won-lost mark and a 4.08 ERA. In pitching 39.2 innings, he has totaled 41 strikeouts and 13 walks.
