						It was a good day for the Wind Surge at Principal Park as they clipped the <a href="../teams/team_171.html">Iowa Cubs</a>, 8-5. It was tremendous day for <a href="../players/player_32178.html">Christian Lopes</a>, who was on a hitting barrage at the plate, finishing 5-for-5. <br><br>"I don't know what to call that," the <a href="../teams/team_175.html">Wichita</a> second baseman told reporters after his big performance. "I'm not 'dialed in' or 'in a zone,' I just try to keep it simple. Basically the pitcher throws the ball, I try to pick up the spin, then I hit it. Today I picked up the spin pretty well." <br><br><a href="../players/player_32178.html">Christian Lopes</a> doubled in the 1st, hit an RBI single in the 2nd, hit an RBI single in the 4th, singled in the 6th, walked in the 8th and singled in the 9th.<br><br>For the year <a href="../players/player_32178.html">Lopes</a> is hitting .277 with 2 home runs. His stats include 22 runs batted in and 26 runs scored.
