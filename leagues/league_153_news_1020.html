						File this story under "whoda' thunk it?" <a href="../teams/team_48.html">New York Yankees</a>'s closer <a href="../players/player_25847.html">Aroldis Chapman</a> is seen by some as being aloof and a bit of a loner. "I'd call him 'intense,'" teammate <a href="../players/player_18530.html">Chris Iannetta</a> put it judiciously. Chapman's reputation isn't helped by his sometimes contentious relationship with the media, and most reporters would agree that he's not the easiest player to interview, let alone get to know. If he'd agree to talk with you, Chapman would probably explain that he puts all of his effort into his peformance on the field, and that he's focused on winning a championship, not a popularity contest.<br><br>So everybody agrees that Chapman is, as the old-timers would say, a "tough egg." But maybe he isn't as hard-boiled as most folks might think. An inside source recently reported that Chapman has been volunteering his time at the  Childrens' Memorial Hospital in New York. When initially confronted with the story, Chapman angrily denied it, but his teammates were unanimous in support of his generous and, frankly, unexpected gesture. "It shows what we always suspected, that his heart is in the right place," said Iannetta. "He really cares about kids, and that's what counts in the end."<br><br>Does this signal the emergence of a kinder, gentler Chapman? Maybe, maybe not. But don't be surprised if you see him a get a few more high-fives from his fellow New York players and perhaps a few more autograph requests from some of the kids who benefitted from his previously secret generosity.
