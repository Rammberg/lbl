						It was all about winning for the <a href="../teams/team_251.html">South Bend Cubs</a> -- and win they did.<br><br>There was nothing fancy in how they went about it, players said, they just prepared mentally and physically and then went out and played baseball.<br><br>"We did the little things right and we did the big things right," said second baseman <a href="../players/player_23107.html">Levi Jordan</a>, who was named series MVP. "Now we're the league champions."<br><br>South Bend defeated the <a href="../teams/team_257.html">Kane County Cougars</a> by a score of 7-2 at Northwestern Medicine Field to take the series 3-1.<br><br>"Sometimes you get lucky and sometimes you make your own luck," said South Bend manager Buddy Bailey. "We got lucky a few times, but mostly we did the right things by being prepared for each game and playing the game the way it's meant to be played."
