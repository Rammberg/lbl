						The fans at Target Field saw it all yesterday in the Twins-Indians game -- pushes, shoves, scuffles, a few tackles, a few swings, a few feeble punches -- and a baseball game, too. When the ruckus was over, only two players were sent to the showers by the umpire crew. <a href="../teams/team_47.html">Minnesota</a>'s <a href="../players/player_29365.html">Ehire Adrianza</a> and <a href="../teams/team_38.html">Cleveland</a>'s <a href="../players/player_34597.html">Hunter Wood</a> were ejected from the game.<br><br>Today the two players were suspended 3 games by the league commissioner.<br><br>This year <a href="../players/player_29365.html">Adrianza</a> is hitting .293 with 6 home runs and 36 RBIs to his credit.
