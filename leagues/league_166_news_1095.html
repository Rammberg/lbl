"I knew from the fifth inning that I had a no-hitter working. I tried to get it out of my mind, but you just can't. They have too many scoreboards in the park. They're everywhere you look."<br><br>The right-hander faced only 29 batters in the no-hit gem, struck out 6 and walked 1.<br><br>"We simply couldn't get any wood on the ball," Greeneville manager <a href="../coaches/coach_1560.html">Derrin Ebert</a> said when asked about the epic performance. "<a href="../players/player_27998.html">Murdock</a> was brilliant out there. He certainly had our number."<br><br>Looking at his season stats, <a href="../players/player_27998.html">Murdock</a> has won 1 and lost 1, collecting 19 strikeouts and 8 walks in 28 innings with a 1.93 ERA.
