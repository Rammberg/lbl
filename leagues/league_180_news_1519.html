						<a href="../players/player_40989.html">Fabian Pertuz</a> of the <a href="../teams/team_742.html">Chicago N (DSL) Cubs 2</a> was not happy with <a href="../players/player_40601.html">Yeury Tatiz</a>, and his frustration showed when he went after the <a href="../teams/team_589.html">Seattle (DSL)</a> player during yesterday's game at Baseball City Complex. Both benches cleared as they rushed to the aid of their teammates. Order was soon restored as <a href="../players/player_40989.html">Pertuz</a> and <a href="../players/player_40601.html">Tatiz</a> were pulled away from each other. They were ejected from the game.<br><br>Both players were suspended 4 games by the league office as a result of their tussle.<br><br>"It's something that happens in baseball every once in a while," <a href="../players/player_40989.html">Pertuz</a> commented later. "We get frustrated with another player and sometimes things go too far. We'll both take our suspensions and then come back ready to play. I got no hard feelings."<br><br>In 63 games this season <a href="../players/player_40989.html">Pertuz</a> has compiled a .268 batting average with 59 hits and 1 home run. He has also scored 30 times and knocked in 25 runs.<br><br><a href="../players/player_40601.html">Tatiz</a> has taken the mound for 9 relief appearances this season, nailing down no saves while notching a 2-1 record with a 5.73 ERA. The <a href="../teams/team_589.html">Seattle (DSL)</a> reliever has limited opposing batters to a .312 batting average.
