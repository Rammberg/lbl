						It was a good day for the Giants at Oracle Park as they clipped the <a href="../teams/team_60.html">Washington Nationals</a>, 21-7. It was tremendous day for <a href="../players/player_19149.html">Evan Longoria</a>, who was on a hitting barrage at the plate, finishing 5-for-6. <br><br>"I don't know what to call that," the <a href="../teams/team_55.html">San Francisco</a> third baseman told reporters after his big performance. "I'm not 'dialed in' or 'in a zone,' I just try to keep it simple. Basically the pitcher throws the ball, I try to pick up the spin, then I hit it. Today I picked up the spin pretty well." <br><br><a href="../players/player_19149.html">Evan Longoria</a> flied out in the 1st, doubled in the 3rd, singled in the 4th, hit an RBI single in the 6th, hit an RBI single in the 7th and hit a solo-shot off <a href="../players/player_30150.html">Michael A. Taylor</a> in the 8th.<br><br>In 9 games this season <a href="../players/player_19149.html">Longoria</a> has compiled a .273 batting average with 9 hits and 1 home run. He has also scored 10 times and knocked in 5 runs.<br><br><a href="../box_scores/game_box_981.html">View Boxscore</a>
